    //Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time, however, the compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it.
    //Scalar types represent a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.
    //Integers are a number without a fractional component. Rust has signed and unsigned integers. Signed integers can be positive, negative, or zero. Unsigned integers can only be positive or zero.
    //Signed integers are i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, and isize. The number after i indicates the number of bits the integer type takes up.
    //Unsigned integers are u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, and usize. The number after u indicates the number of bits the integer type takes up.
    //Integer literals can be expressed in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary, and byte (u8 only) formats.
    //Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component. Rust has two primitive types for floating-point numbers: f32 and f64. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs it's roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision.
    //Boolean types are either true or false. Booleans are one byte in size.
